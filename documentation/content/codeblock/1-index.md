The growth and urbanization of human settlements has been accompanied by an expansive use of electric lighting. Although of importance to enhace the quality and productivity of human activities, particularly at night, widespread use of artificial light has transformed the nocturnal landscape. Calculations estimate an average 6% annual increase in artificial light at night (ALAN) emission, with over 23% of the land surface of the planet experiencing increased levels of night sky brightness due to skyglow, a consequence of light scattering and rebounding on atmospheric particles that creates a halo of light that can affect areas many kilometers away from the source point.

This increase in light levels has had unintended consequences on the biodiversity of the world at large, that are only recently being addressed.
Implications for biodiversity

Among the effects that ALAN has on biodiversity, research groups across the globe have noted the following:

* It disrupts light/dark cycles which regulate biological rhythms that affect diverse aspects of physiology and behaviour. For example, longer exposure to artificial light has been associated to altered activity patterns (like sleeping, foraging or mating) in mammals, birds and amphibians.

* Specific animal groups, like insects, are specially affected. A 'fatal attraction' relationship has been documented between insects and artificial light sources; a study estimated over 100 billion insect deaths per summer associated to this attraction. Indeed, some researchers have proposed that light pollution might have a role in the severe decline in insect populations known as the 'insect apocalypse'.

* Organisms that rely heavily on light as a cue to respond to changes in their environment, like plants and plankton, are also affected.

* Animal movement and spatial distribution can also be disrupted by ALAN; migrating species can be attracted to light sources which can modify their course and increase their energy expenditure, reducing fitness. Other species might avoid moving between sites with increased light brightness, thus limiting movement between otherwise adequate habitat patches.

These effects might be more severe for nocturnal species, which comprise around 30% of known vertebrates and 60% of known invertebrates. Furthermore, ALAN might have the potential to affect ecosystem functioning and stability, through the selective impact on groups that represent food sources and thus altering trophic chains.
