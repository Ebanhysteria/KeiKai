Welcome to Keikai!

This online platform provides a visualization of the evolution of the encroachment of light pollution in protected areas.  

Protected areas are a conservation tool of paramount importance in light of the accelerated land-use change caused by human activities.  By protecting large extensions of habitat, they preserve not only the species than inhabit them, but the ecological processes and biological interactions that are critical to ecosystem functioning, and that provide humans with a wealth of ecosystem services.  

The most recent report indicates that approximately [15%](https://www.protectedplanet.net/en) of the terrestrial area in the world is under some protection regime.  

Criteria to designate protected areas are diverse, but typically include measures of biological diversity and landscape connectivity. While the intention of protected areas is to ensure that their designation buffers them against severe impacts of human activities, this is not always the case.  In particular, sources of diffuse pollution can infiltrate and cause negative effects on the ecological integrity of this areas.  

One such source is light pollution, which is, incidentally, rarely considered as a criterion to designate and manage protected areas.  However, recent studies have found that, while protected areas tend to be darker than non-protected ones, [the proportion of dark areas within protected sites has been decreasing](http://kevingaston.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Gaston_et_al-2015-quantifying-erosion-of-natural-darkness-in-GPA.pdf).  Because light pollution might function as a barrier to species movement between otherwise adequate habitat patches, there is increasing awareness of the importance of including it as a parameter to define ecological corridors. In addition to affecting animal movement, light pollution has other negative effects on biodiversity.
